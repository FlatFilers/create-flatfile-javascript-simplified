This is a JavaScript Project using the simplified configuration for the [Flatfile JavaScript SDK](https://flatfile.com/docs/apps/embedding/javascript/guide)

### Getting Started
Get your Environment Id and your Publishable Key from the Developer Settings in your account. These should look like:
`publishable_key="pk_12345"`
and
`environment_id="us_env_12345"`

You will add these to your index.html under the `FlatFileJavaScript.startFlatfile()` declaration

After adding your environment id and publishable key you can open the index.html in your browser and get uploading!
